# movie-api
An API that does CRUD operation on a film database

## About the Project 

During my first year at [ITS ICT Piemonte](https://www.its-ictpiemonte.it) I attended a RESTful API course to get an introduction about this tecnology and how to use it. The main example was a movie API developed by my teacher used to test various type of endpoint using [Insomia](https://insomnia.rest). In this repo I redevelop the movie api using the [documentation](./docs.yaml) about its use left by my teacher. The project will be also deployd [on railway.app](https://railway.app)
